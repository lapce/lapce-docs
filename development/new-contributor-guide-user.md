[This guide](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), by Eric Steven Raymond, is about how to ask excellent questions. You can apply the same techniques (such as _Use meaningful, specific subject headers_) to suggestions and bug reports. The more specific (and helpful!) you can be with your question, the more it helps us to provide a solution.
