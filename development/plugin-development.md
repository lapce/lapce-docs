# Plugin Development

## Publish plugin

You can publish your plugin to the Lapce plugin registry ([https://plugins.lapce.dev/](http://plugins.lapce.dev/)) by a cli.

To install the cli, run

`cargo install volts`

On plugins.lapce.dev, login via Github, and you can create an API token to use for the cli.

Then in the plugin folder, run

`volts publish`

It should publish the plugin to the registry.
